Instructions: Create a list with at least 8 numbers, and make sure you have a raandom dispersement between 0-50
Create a loop (which loop would be best given we know how long we're going [the length of the list]?) that runs through the entire list
Inside of your loop, have an if/elif/else that checks AT EACH INDEX OF THE LIST:
if the number is greater than 35: print ("greater than 35")
elif the number is between 20-35: print ("between 20-35")
elif the number is between 5-20: print ("between 5 and 20")
else (the number is less than 5)

    for x in numbers:
        if x > 35:
            print (x, "greater than 35")
        elif 20 < x < 35:
            print(x, "between 20-35")
        elif 5 < x < 20:
            print(x, "between 5 and 20")
